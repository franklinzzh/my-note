# 🧠 My Note

> A personal knowledge base documenting my journey — from learning how to use a Mac,
>  to coding fluently in Java, and mastering Data Structures & Algorithms.
>
> It serves as both a **learning log** and a **reference** for interview prep, projects, and continuous growth.

## 📚 Learning Path

* `Command.md` contains every basic command from `Mac command` to `Terminal` and `Java Coding`
* `Java.md` includes the fundamental knowledge that could be asked in the interview. It helps to understand why your project works this way.
* `Interesting knowledge.md` is a seperate group of useful knowledge and Tips in learning code.
* `Algorithm.md` including every detailed and grouped algorithm for **LeetCode** study, still updating...
* `Web-project.md` is the current project I'm doing right now.
* `Review Data Structure & Algorithm.md` is coming from the course CSE373.
